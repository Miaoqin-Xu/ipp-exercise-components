# Programming in Python - An Introduction: Lab Module 02

### Description

Briefly describe the objectives of the Lab Module:

1) To understand and use booleans, formatted strings, numeric calculations, numeric syntax expressions, and sequence types (lists, tuples, ranges) in Python.

2) 

3) 


### Exercise Activities

List the actions you took in implementing the Lab Module:

1) Read the lab summary and followed the DEV instructions to complete all Python syntax exercises.

2) I did add randint to finish the tasks that was told to have an int between a provided range

3) 


### Unit and/or Integration Tests Executed

List the tests you exercised in validating your functionality for the Lab Module:

1) Validated functionality for int and float data types.


2) Executed tests for arithmetic expressions and f-string formatting.


3) Verified boolean and list-based sequence operations for expected outcomes.
